### Samples Info ###

New to CBEffects? Not new to CBEffects? I've created a cache of samples just for you.

Use each sample by `require()`-ing the file; samples start automatically. After you start up a sample, look into the code and see what was required to create it. You'll also notice, at the top of each sample, there *may* be an "Academic Section". That's a tutorial for what's going on in that sample.

```Lua
require("samples.Dynamics.RadiusTransition")
```

If you're a beginner, I'd recommend starting in this order:
 * GettingStarted/BasicVent
 * GettingStarted/LoadPreset
 * GettingStarted/HelloWorld
 * GettingStarted/DoubleVent
 * GettingStarted/BasicEvents
 * PositionType/BasicRadius
