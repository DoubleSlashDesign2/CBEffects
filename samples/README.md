### Samples Info

New to CBE? Not new to CBE? I've created a cache of samples just for you.

Use each sample by clicking the corresponding button when you start the CBE sample app. After you start up a sample, look into the code and see what was required to create it. You'll also notice, at the top of each sample, there *may* be an "Academic Section". That's a tutorial for what's going on in that sample.

If you're a beginner, I'd recommend starting in this order:
 * GettingStarted/BasicVent
 * GettingStarted/LoadPreset
 * GettingStarted/HelloWorld
 * GettingStarted/DoubleVent
 * GettingStarted/BasicEvents
 * PositionType/BasicRadius
 * Everything else; go crazy
