SampleCache Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New to CBEffects? I've created a cache of samples just for you.

Use each sample by require()-ing the file; samples start automatically. After you start up a sample, look into the code and see what was required to create it. You'll also notice, at the top of each sample, there may be an "Academic Section". That's a tutorial for what's going on in that sample. I haven't written one for each sample yet, but they're there for some of them.

If you're a beginner, I'd recommend starting in this order:
 * GettingStarted/BasicVent
 * GettingStarted/LoadPreset
 * GettingStarted/HelloWorld
 * GettingStarted/DoubleVent
 * GettingStarted/BasicEvents
