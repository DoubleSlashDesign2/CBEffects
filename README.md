## CBEffects for CoronaÂ® SDK

As the ultimate particle effects system of Corona SDK, CBEffects melds ease of use and infinite flexibility to create a vastly powerful engine and a completely new way of creating and managing particle effects. It gives you utter control over the very fabric of each particle to provide the quickest, easiest, and most beatiful visuals Corona SDK can create. Rather than forcing the programmer to stick to tight rules and rigid guidelines, CBEffects allows the programmer to completely customize every minute aspect of their effect, while at the same time allowing the user to step back and let the engine take over, if they so desire. The best part? It's completely free and open-source.

#### Using this Repository

Copy the folder named "CBEffects" (that's where the actual engine lives) into your project's **root** directory (the one with `main.lua` in it). Then, at the top of whichever scene you're planning on using CBEffects in, add the following:
```Lua
local CBE = require("CBEffects.Library")
```
That's it!

##### Note for all current users:

Please start using `.newVent()` and `.newVentGroup()` rather than `.NewVent()` and `.VentGroup()`; do the same for fields. The original function calls will still work, but it's recommended that you switch to the new name for conformity.

#### Last Library Update 

Version Name: 3.0 

Released: January 2014 

To upgrade for the Corona graphics library upgrade, a new release of CBEffects has been written and turned CBEffects back into the "one particle system to rule them all". With a completely rewritten core engine, new capabilities, numerous minor enhancements, and a new internal multi-file format, CBEffects 3.0 is the most advanced version yet of the most advanced Corona SDK particle system yet.
